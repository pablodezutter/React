##Creating ToDoApp 19th of June
(reading info on React & watching youtube, thanks to
Kirupa Chinnathambi, dev ED and TiffInTech)

- Index.js -> App.js -> TodoList.js
- Remove files (not needed)
- import bootstrap npm + index.html link
- always import components!
- we need the events to work so: constructor!
  (before render)
- addItem (e) = for event arguments
  (do we need constructor and super?)
- creating function

  - create item with unique id
